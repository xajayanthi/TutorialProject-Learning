    <h1>Making coffee</h1>

    <h2>Brewing</h2>

    <p>
        Coffee can be brewed in several different ways, but these methods fall into four main groups depending on how the water is 
        introduced to the coffee grounds: decoction (through boiling), infusion (through steeping), gravitational feed 
        (used with percolators and in drip brewing), or pressurized percolation (as with espresso).
    </p>

    <p>
        Brewed coffee, if kept hot, will deteriorate rapidly in flavor, and reheating such coffee tends to give it a "muddy" flavour, 
        as some compounds that impart flavor to coffee are destroyed if this is done. Even at room temperature, deterioration will occur; 
        however, if kept in an oxygen-free environment it can last almost indefinitely at room temperature, 
        and sealed containers of brewed coffee are sometimes commercially available in food stores in America or Europe, 
        with refrigerated bottled coffee drinks being commonly available at convenience stores and grocery stores in the United States. 
        Canned coffee is particularly popular in Japan and South Korea.

       <h3>Boiling</h3>
        <p>
            Boiling, or decoction, was the main method used for brewing coffee until the 1930s[4] and is still used in some Nordic and Middle Eastern countries.[5] The aromatic oils in coffee are released at 96 °C (205 °F), which is just below boiling, while the bitter acids are released when the water has reached boiling point.[6]

            The simplest method is to put the ground coffee in a cup, pour hot water over it and let cool while the grounds sink to the bottom. This is a traditional method for making a cup of coffee that is still used in parts of Indonesia. This method, known as "mud coffee" in the Middle East owing to an extremely fine grind that results in a mud-like sludge at the bottom of the cup, allows for extremely simple preparation, but drinkers then have to be careful if they want to avoid drinking grounds either from this layer or floating at the surface of the coffee, which can be avoided by dribbling cold water onto the "floaters" from the back of a spoon. If the coffee beans are not ground finely enough, the grounds do not sink.

            "Cowboy coffee" is made by heating coarse grounds with water in a pot, letting the grounds settle and pouring off the liquid to drink, sometimes filtering it to remove fine grounds. While the name suggests that this method was used by cowboys, presumably on the trail around a campfire, it is used by others; some people prefer this method.

            The above methods are sometimes used with hot milk instead of water.

        <h3>Steeping</h3>
        <p>
            A cafetière, or French press, is a tall, narrow cylinder with a plunger that includes a metal or nylon fine mesh filter. The grounds are placed in the cylinder, and off-the-boil water is then poured into it. The coffee and hot water are left in the cylinder for a few minutes (typically 4–7 minutes) and then the plunger is gently pushed down, leaving the filter immediately above the grounds, allowing the coffee to be poured out while the filter retains the grounds. Depending on the type of filter, it is important to pay attention to the grind of the coffee beans, though a rather coarse grind is almost always called for.[7] A plain glass cylinder may be used, or a vacuum flask arrangement to keep the coffee hot; this is not to be confused with a vacuum brewer—see below.

        <h3>Filteration methods</h3>
        <p>
            Drip brew coffee, also known as filtered coffee, is made by letting hot water drip onto coffee grounds held in a coffee filter surrounded by a filter holder or brew basket. Drip brew makers can be simple filter holder types manually filled with hot water, or they can use automated systems as found in the popular electric drip coffee-maker. Strength varies according to the ratio of water to coffee and the fineness of the grind, but is typically weaker in taste and contains a lower concentration of caffeine than espresso, though often (due to size) more total caffeine.[8] By convention, regular coffee brewed by this method is served by some restaurants in a brown or black pot (or a pot with a brown or black handle), while decaffeinated coffee is served in an orange pot (or a pot with an orange handle).
